                    Understanding Deaf culture, the uniqueness of the Deaf community, and their ideology, especially how
                    they view themselves in comparison to other ordinary people and their interactions with other
                    groups. Through this research, 'entering' the Deaf community to understand their sensitivities,
                    concerns, and needs. This aids in designing more reasonable solutions and researching how to
                    ethically and legally obtain data.

                <p>
                    After researching the previous paper, the biggest challenge in the current ASL research comes from
                    participants' privacy concerns. They are unwilling to provide facial data. The focus of this step is
                    to study how to use dynamic video filter technology to cover some identifying information, thus
                    protecting participants' privacy and encouraging them to provide facial data.

                </h2>
                <p>
                    By technical means, provide methods of anonymity and de-identification to build an online ASL data
                    sharing platform. This platform allows more participants to share data in a safer, cost-effective
                    way, paving the way for future crowdsourced AI research.

                <p>
                    Based on past research and my own experience, biases in generative AI can have severe negative
                    impacts on the fields of communication, social interaction, and media. However, if these biases
                    persist, they might mislead users right from the start, especially causing detrimental effects on
                    younger users. I am passionate about researching and analyzing how to identify, uncover, and reduce
                    biases, as well as the errors in AI's understanding of humans, in order to maintain a balanced
                    social media environment and protect and educate the youth to discern accurate information.
